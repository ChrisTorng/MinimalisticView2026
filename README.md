## About This Port

This extension is **not** directly converted from the original [poma/MinimalisticView](https://github.com/poma/MinimalisticView) source code.

Instead, it was created by:
1. Downloading the [MinimalisticView_VS2022.vsix.xlsx](https://github.com/poma/MinimalisticView/files/8843494/MinimalisticView_VS2022.vsix.xlsx) file provided by [lesterlo](https://github.com/lesterlo) in the [Visual Studio 2022 Support](https://github.com/poma/MinimalisticView/issues/18) issue thread
2. Renaming the `.vsix` file to `.zip` and extracting its contents
3. Modifying the Visual Studio version requirements to support Visual Studio 2026 Insiders

## Original Extension

The original extension was created by [Poma](https://github.com/poma) and can be found at:
- Marketplace: [Hide Main Menu, Title Bar, and Tabs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Poma.MinimalisticView)
- GitHub: [poma/MinimalisticView](https://github.com/poma/MinimalisticView)

## Original [README.md](https://github.com/poma/MinimalisticView/blob/master/README.md)

This extension hides Menu bar, Title bar, and Tab Well. Menu and title bar are in auto-hide mode and are accessible if you press "Alt" or "Ctrl-Q" hotkey or hover mouse over window top. Tabs can also be hidden and you can easily switch between them using Ctrl-Tab or Ctrl-, and other navigation hotkeys.

You can configure setting in Options -> Environment -> MinimalisticView

An extension for programmers who don't use mouse when writing code and want to get rid of unneeded panels that are taking up space and distracting from code.

If you are interested in extension please rate or review it - if enough people are interested I will develop more options and usability features. So far looks like nobody else uses it.
