## About This Port

This extension is **not** directly converted from the original [poma/MinimalisticView](https://github.com/poma/MinimalisticView) source code.

Instead, it was created by:
1. Downloading the [MinimalisticView_VS2022.vsix.xlsx](https://github.com/poma/MinimalisticView/files/8843494/MinimalisticView_VS2022.vsix.xlsx) file provided by [lesterlo](https://github.com/lesterlo) in the [Visual Studio 2022 Support](https://github.com/poma/MinimalisticView/issues/18) issue thread
2. Renaming the `.vsix` file to `.zip` and extracting its contents
3. Modifying the Visual Studio version requirements to support Visual Studio 2026 Insiders

- Marketplace: [Hide Main Menu, Title Bar, and Tabs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Poma.MinimalisticView)
